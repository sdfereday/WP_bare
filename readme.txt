- Always edit EM3 in this project, never outside.
- Always make sure correct release protocols are kept in mind.
- Always make this generic, no specific client themes.
- The child theme is there as an example only, set other sites up with their own.
- Ensure to copy across em3 to sites, never the other way around.
