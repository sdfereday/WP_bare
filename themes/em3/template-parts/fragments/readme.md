In theory these fragments don't need to be used as you can pretty much auto-generate based on various assumption. However, I've elected to
include these as it offers a little bit extra control over what uses what. I've tried to stay away from using too many div classes, but some
have been kept in just to offer again some form of targeting should that ever be required.

Again these aren't needed (apart from the parent classes for layout purposes), but they could come in useful.
